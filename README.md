# Oowd

WIP: Turn object-oriented libraries reactive using Lwd.

The library `oowd` defines concepts for turning a graphical library reactive.
It's intended to be used with libraries that use mutable objects with
parent/child relations and callbacks.
Inheritance-based callbacks are not supported.

The library `lablgtk3-lwd` allow using Gtk3 in a reactive way, see the
[example/](example/) directory.
